    "In real HPC environments, software is often not available, outdated, or needs specific compiler optimizations for your project. Mastering the installation of software from source is not only about 'getting it to work' — it’s about taking control of your computational environment, maximizing performance, and enabling reproducible science. Software installation is an essential survival skill in HPC. And using the right environment and tools is critical to not reinvent the wheel and use the resources more efficiently. Real life examples are: \n",
    "- A production cluster that has GCC 8 but you need C++20 features (GCC 11+).\n",
    "- Building MPI or HDF5 with specific flags for performance (or GPUs).\n",
    "- Needing newer Python packages, but the cluster limits pip install.\n",
    "- The Reproducibility Crisis & Your Research: \"Imagine publishing a groundbreaking result, but nobody, not even your future self, can replicate it because the exact software environment is lost. Manually installing and managing software correctly is the first step towards reproducible computational science.\"\n",
    "- Bleeding Edge vs. Stability: Your research often demands the latest features or bug fixes in a scientific library (e.g., a new algorithm in TensorFlow, a fix in GROMACS). System administrators, prioritizing stability, might offer older versions. Learning to install software yourself gives you access to the cutting edge.\n",
    "- Performance is Key: HPC is about speed! Generic software provided by admins might not be compiled with optimizations for the specific processor architecture (like AVX-512) or linked against high-performance libraries (like MKL) available on your cluster. Compiling from source allows you to tailor the build for maximum performance.\n",
    "- The \"It Doesn't Exist\" Problem: Sometimes, the specialized tool you need simply isn't available at all via system package managers or modules. Your only option is to build it from source.\n",
    "- Dependency Hell: Software rarely lives in isolation. Program A needs Library B version 1.2, but Program C needs Library B version 2.0. How do you manage this without conflicts, especially without root access? This is a core challenge we'll address. (This sets the stage nicely for Spack).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, software is available through `modules`, and it can be \"loaded\" into the current shell environment by using \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module load SOFTWARE/VERSION\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can use several versions of the same software, something that you cannot do using `apt` or similar. In the following we will see a specific tool called `spack` that allows to install software in a hpc environment, and use it, and is compatible with the module tools (see <https://docs.gwdg.de/doku.php?id=en:services:application_services:high_performance_computing:spack_and_modulefiles>. It is typical to loose a day or a week installing and configuring software, so is better to use the right tools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE regarding python**: My current suggestion is to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Using tools like spack helps to solve many problems, like\n",
    "- ✅ Dependency Management — source installs often require satisfying many dependencies manually (painful) while Spack automates this.\n",
    "- ✅ Conflicts and Errors (e.g., missing a dependency or wrong compiler).\n",
    "- ✅ Uninstalling — (e.g., make uninstall if available, or just delete directories).\n",
    "- ✅ Environment Issues — binaries installed outside of default paths won't be found unless PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH is modified.\n",
    "- ✅ Parallel Builds — make -j$(nproc) — very practical in HPC!\n",
    "- ✅ Simple performance aspect  (e.g., using -O3 flags).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other tools to install/manage packages:\n",
    "- Environment Modules (Lmod/Tcl): Managing environment variables (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.) without conflicts. Basic commands: module avail, module list, module load <pkg>, module unload <pkg>, module purge, module spider <pkg> (or module keyword <pkg>). Notice that spack can generate module files (spack module tcl refresh -y <pkg>), bridging the gap between installing with Spack and using the software easily. Even manually installed software should ideally have a module file created for it.\n",
    "- Conda: Pros: Easy to use, large package ecosystem (especially Python/R). Cons: Can sometimes have performance issues (binaries not always optimized for HPC hardware/interconnects), environment conflicts with system modules, potential storage bloat. Often better for interactive work or specific workflows than core HPC tasks.\n",
    "- uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ A modern , fast, and it is becoming the standard. \n",
    "- EasyBuild: Another widely used HPC-centric build automation tool, similar in scope to Spack.\n",
    "- Containers (Singularity/Apptainer): Alternative way to package and run software with its entire environment. They solve similar problems but work differently (packaging vs. native installation). high importance for portability and reproducibility, especially across different clusters."

    "## Shell env vars introduction\n",
    "Environment variables are dynamic values that affect how processes run on a computer. They are part of the environment in which a process runs and can influence program behavior without requiring code changes. These variables are crucial for configuring system behavior, program execution paths, and runtime behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are modern tools that automate setting env vars per project, like `.env` files, [direnv](https://direnv.net/), and even dockerfiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PATH` variable is one of the most important environment variables. It specifies a list of directories where the shell looks for executable programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# View your current PATH\n",
    "echo $PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example output\n",
    "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "- Determines which programs can be run without specifying their full path\n",
    "- Affects which versions of programs are executed when multiple versions exist\n",
    "- Essential for running commands from any directory without typing the full path\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example usage:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Adding a directory to PATH temporarily\n",
    "export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/directory\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding permanently (in your shell profile file like .bashrc or .zshrc)\n",
    "echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/directory' >> ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` specifies directories where the dynamic linker should look for shared libraries before checking the standard locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# View current LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n",
    "echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "- Critical for running programs that depend on specific library versions\n",
    "- Essential when installing software in non-standard locations\n",
    "- Helps resolve \"library not found\" errors without system-wide installation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example usage:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH temporarily\n",
    "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libraries:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "# Running a program with a specific library path\n",
    "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libs ./your_program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Important Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PYTHONPATH**: Directories where Python looks for modules\n",
    "- **JAVA_HOME**: Base directory of your Java installation\n",
    "- **LANG** and **LC_ALL**: Control system locale and language settings\n",
    "- **HOME**: Path to the current user's home directory\n",
    "- **USER**: Current username\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting and Using Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporary Setting (Current Session Only)\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export VARIABLE_NAME=value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Permanent Setting\n",
    "Add to your shell profile file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo 'export VARIABLE_NAME=value' >> ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Variables in Scripts\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "echo \"Your PATH is: $PATH\"\n",
    "if [ -z \"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\" ]; then\n",
    "  echo \"LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set\"\n",
    "else\n",
    "  echo \"Libraries will be searched in: $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\n",
    "fi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compiling Programs\n",
    "- **CPATH/C_INCLUDE_PATH**: Directories for C header files\n",
    "- **LIBRARY_PATH**: Directories for static libraries during link time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running Programs with Custom Libraries\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Running with specific library paths\n",
    "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/custom/lib ./my_program\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compiling with specific include paths\n",

    "### Preliminary concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important for you to know a little how your operating system and\n",
    "the shell look for commands. In general, the `PATH` variable stores the\n",
    "directories where the shell interpreter will look for a given command.\n",
    "To check its contents, you can run the following,\n",
    "\n",
    "If, for instance, you want to add another directory to the `PATH`, like\n",
    "the directory `$HOME/local/bin`, you can run the following\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This appends the special directory to the old content of the `PATH`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to compile a given program that uses some other libraries,\n",
    "you must specify any extra folder to look for include files, done with\n",
    "the `-I` flag, and for libraries, done with the `-L` and `-l` flags. For\n",
    "instance, let's assume that you installed some programs in your\n",
    "`HOME/local`, the include files inside `$HOME/local/include`, and the\n",
    "libraries inside `$HOME/local/lib`. If you want to tell the compiler to\n",
    "use those, you must compile as\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, whenever you are installing a program from source you must be\n",
    "aware that this reduces to basically the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Download and untar the file. Enter the unpacked directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Read the README/INSTALL files for any important info.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  If the program uses cmake, create a build dir and then use cmake to\n",
    "    generate the Makefiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    mkdir build\n",
    "    cd build\n",
    "    cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, if the program uses `configure`, then configure\n",
    "    the system to install on the required path\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Compile and install the program, maybe using many threads\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    make -j 4 # uses for threads to compile\n",
    "    make install\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Done. The program is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, when compiling, do not forget to use the flags `-L` and\n",
    "    `-I` appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting all the flags and making sure to use the right version is\n",
    "sometimes difficult, so tools like `spack` aim to manage and simplify\n",
    "this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking the version for already installed programs\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are used to `apt-get` or something related, you can use the\n",
    "package manager to check. But, in general, you can check the versions by\n",
    "looking at the appropriate places on your system. Typically, if you are\n",
    "looking for a library, they are installed under `/usr/lib` or\n",
    "`/usr/local/lib`, while include files are installed under `/usr/include`\n",
    "or `/usr/local/include` . For instance, if you are looking for library\n",
    "`foo`, then you should look for the file `libfoo.a` or `libfoo.so` . One\n",
    "useful utility for this is the command `locate` or `find` .\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "locate libfoo\n",
    "find /usr/lib -iname \"*libfoo*\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute these commands to check the actual versions for fftw, eigen, and\n",
    "git. What versions do you have? If you a re looking for a program, or an\n",
    "specific version of program, you must check if the program exists by\n",
    "executing it. For command line programs you usually can check the\n",
    "version by using the following\n",
    "\n",
    "where `programname` is the name of the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing the local places to install the utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we will install everything under the `$HOME/local`\n",
    "subdirectory inside your home, so please create it. Remember that the\n",
    "symbol `$HOME` means your home directory. The utilies will then create\n",
    "the appropriate folders there. **NOTE:** Better use the `$HOME` var\n",
    "instead of `~`, which is another way to state the name of your home.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical installation algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Download the source from the project page. This normally implies\n",
    "    downloading a tarball (file ending with `.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2`) .\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Un-compress the downloaded file. For a tarball, the command will be\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    tar xf filename.tar.gz\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Enter to the newly uncompressed folder (almost always usually `cd\n",
    "      filename`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **READ** the `README` and/or the `INSTALL` file to check for\n",
    "    important info regarding the program. SOmetimes these files tell you\n",
    "    that the installation is special and that you are required to follow\n",
    "    some special steps (that will happen with `voro++` )\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **CONFIGURATION:** You have two options, each one independent on the\n",
    "    other:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  If the program has a configure script, then just run\n",
    "\n",
    "        ``` shell\n",
    "        ./configure --help\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    to check all the available options. Since we want to install on the\n",
    "    `$HOME/local` directory, then we need to run\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you don't specify the prefix, then the program will be installed\n",
    "    on the `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` directories, whatever is the\n",
    "    default. If these commands ends successfully, it will print some\n",
    "    info to the screen and will tell you to go to the next step.\n",
    "    Otherwise you will need to read the log and fix the errors (like\n",
    "    installing a dependency).\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  If the program uses `cmake`, a makefile generator and\n",
    "\n",
    "    configurator, then you need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    mkdir build # creates a build directory to put there the temporary built files\n",
    "    cd build \n",
    "    cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/local # configure the building process for the source code located on the parent directory\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **COMPILATION:** Now that you have configured your installation, you\n",
    "    need to compile by using the GNU make utility (*Note:* All this\n",
    "    build utilities come from the gnu organization and are free software\n",
    "    as in freedom). If you have several cores, you can use them in\n",
    "    parallel, assuming the that the Makefile and your make versions\n",
    "    supports it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    make -j 3 # for three cores, but, if you are unsure, just use one core.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Any errors in this stage should be fixed before going to the next\n",
    "    one.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **INSTALLATION** After successful compilation, you can install by\n",
    "    using\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    make install\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will install the program (libraries, binaries, include files,\n",
    "    manual files, etc) onto the `prefix` directory. If you want to\n",
    "    instll system-wide (you did not set the `prefix`), then you need to\n",
    "    use `sudo make install` . In this case you don't need `sudo` since\n",
    "    you are installing on your own home.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **TESTING** In this case use a program to test your installation.\n",
    "    When you compile your program and you want to use the version that\n",
    "    you installed, you need to tell the compiler where to find the\n",
    "    libraries/includes, so you need something like\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    g++ -L $HOME/local/lib -I $HOME/local/include  programname.cpp -llibname\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `-L $HOME/local/lib` tells the compiler to look for libraries on\n",
    "\n",
    "    the `$HOME/local/lib` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `-I $HOME/local/include` tells the compiler to look for include\n",
    "\n",
    "    files on the `$HOME/local/include` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `-llibname` tells the compiler to link with the given\n",
    "\n",
    "    library. Sometimes is not needed. Sometimes is crucial. Be careful,\n",
    "    if your library is called libfftw, you need to write `-lfftw`, not\n",
    "    `-llibfftw`.\n"

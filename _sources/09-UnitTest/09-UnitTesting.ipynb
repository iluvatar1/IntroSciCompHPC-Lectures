    "correct way, at least for the cases one is testing. Once a function is\n",
    "written (or even before in TTD) or a bug is fixed, it is necessary to\n",
    "write a test that ensures the function to work properly in limit cases\n",
    "or the bug to not reappear in the future. There are several levels\n",
    "associated with [unit testing\n",
    ".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), and check <https://matklad.github.io/2021/05/31/how-to-test.html>. Also, check unit testing numerical libraries: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115161\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit we will learn the general philosophy behind it and a couple\n",
    "of tools to implement very basic tests, althoguh the list of [testing\n",
    "frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks)\n",
    "is very large. Furthermore, modularization will be very important, so\n",
    "you must have a clear understanding on how to split some given code into\n",
    "headers, source files, and how to compile objects and then link them\n",
    "using the linker, hopefully through a Makefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that catching an exception (`try` and `catch` blocks) also helps with handling runtime errors and reacting correspondingly (see [c++ exceptions](https://hackingcpp.com/cpp/lang/exceptions.html) and [python exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) ). Also, using logging libraries like logger or [`loguru` (python)](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru), or [`spdlog` c++](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog), allows to print useful logging messages that also helps when you try to understand what is going on with your program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But, how to write and run tests? A test is:\n",
    "- a small piece of code that compares the actual vs. expected behaviour of your software.\n",
    "- some code that you have to write.\n",
    "- should run as automatically as possible.\n",
    "- should run fast.\n",
    "- should fail fast.\n",
    "- should report its status\n",
    "- should track previous results and performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, it is much better to use a test framework, which will run all test and report back results statistics. It can also be integrated with revision control systems, automatic and deployment tasks. For C++, one can use google test, catch2, boost test, cppunit, ..., and for python: pytest, unittest, doctest,  and so on. "

    "# Unit Testing : Making sure your bugs don't come back\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit testing allows to ensure that a given software behaves in the\n",
    "correct way, at least for the cases one is testing. Once a function is\n",
    "written (or even before in TTD) or a bug is fixed, it is necessary to\n",
    "write a test that ensures the function to work properly in limit cases\n",
    "or the bug to not reappear in the future. There are several levels\n",
    "associated with [unit testing\n",
    ".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), and check <https://matklad.github.io/2021/05/31/how-to-test.html>. Also, check unit testing numerical libraries: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115161\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit we will learn the general philosophy behind it and a couple\n",
    "of tools to implement very basic tests, althoguh the list of [testing\n",
    "frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks)\n",
    "is very large. Furthermore, modularization will be very important, so\n",
    "you must have a clear understanding on how to split some given code into\n",
    "headers, source files, and how to compile objects and then link them\n",
    "using the linker, hopefully through a Makefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that catching an exception (`try` and `catch` blocks) also helps with handling runtime errors and reacting correspondingly (see [c++ exceptions](https://hackingcpp.com/cpp/lang/exceptions.html) and [python exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) ). Also, using logging libraries like logger or [`loguru` (python)](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru), or [`spdlog` c++](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog), allows to print useful logging messages that also helps when you try to understand what is going on with your program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But, how to write and run tests? A test is:\n",
    "- a small piece of code that compares the actual vs. expected behaviour of your software.\n",
    "- some code that you have to write.\n",
    "- should run as automatically as possible.\n",
    "- should run fast.\n",
    "- should fail fast.\n",
    "- should report its status\n",
    "- should track previous results and performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, it is much better to use a test framework, which will run all test and report back results statistics. It can also be integrated with revision control systems, automatic and deployment tasks. For C++, one can use google test, catch2, boost test, cppunit, ..., and for python: pytest, unittest, doctest,  and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, try to test all your code or lines of code (code coverage 100%), but do not obsese with it. You can use tools like [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html), [llvm-cov](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html) and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another tip: you can run your test automatically when doing a commit, and if a test is not passed, the commit is not allowed. That keeps your code clean and forces you to commit only passing code. Of course your test must be fast. To configure this, check git pre-commit hooks:\n",

    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the official docs, just clone the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",

    "simplifies the installation of software and also allows to have many\n",
    "versions of the same library, something not easy done manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminary concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important for you to know a little how your operating system and\n",
    "the shell look for commands. In general, the `PATH` variable stores the\n",
    "directories where the shell interpreter will look for a given command.\n",
    "To check its contents, you can run the following,\n",
    "\n",
    "If, for instance, you want to add another directory to the `PATH`, like\n",
    "the directory `$HOME/local/bin`, you can run the following\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This appends the special directory to the old content of the `PATH`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to compile a given program that uses some other libraries,\n",
    "you must specify any extra folder to look for include files, done with\n",
    "the `-I` flag, and for libraries, done with the `-L` and `-l` flags. For\n",
    "instance, let's assume that you installed some programs in your\n",
    "`HOME/local`, the include files inside `$HOME/local/include`, and the\n",
    "libraries inside `$HOME/local/lib`. If you want to tell the compiler to\n",
    "use those, you must compile as\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, whenever you are installing a program from source you must be\n",
    "aware that this reduces to basically the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Download and untar the file. Enter the unpacked directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Read the README/INSTALL files for any important info.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  If the program uses cmake, create a build dir and then use cmake to\n",
    "    generate the Makefiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    mkdir build\n",
    "    cd build\n",
    "    cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, if the program uses `configure`, then configure\n",
    "    the system to install on the required path\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Compile and install the program, maybe using many threads\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    make -j 4 # uses for threads to compile\n",
    "    make install\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Done. The program is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, when compiling, do not forget to use the flags `-L` and\n",
    "    `-I` appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting all the flags and making sure to use the right version is\n",
    "sometimes difficult, so tools like `spack` aim to manage and simplify\n",
    "this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking the version for already installed programs\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are used to `apt-get` or something related, you can use the\n",
    "package manager to check. But, in general, you can check the versions by\n",
    "looking at the appropriate places on your system. Typically, if you are\n",
    "looking for a library, they are installed under `/usr/lib` or\n",
    "`/usr/local/lib`, while include files are installed under `/usr/include`\n",
    "or `/usr/local/include` . For instance, if you are looking for library\n",
    "`foo`, then you should look for the file `libfoo.a` or `libfoo.so` . One\n",
    "useful utility for this is the command `locate` or `find` .\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "locate libfoo\n",
    "find /usr/lib -iname \"*libfoo*\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute these commands to check the actual versions for fftw, eigen, and\n",
    "git. What versions do you have? If you a re looking for a program, or an\n",
    "specific version of program, you must check if the program exists by\n",
    "executing it. For command line programs you usually can check the\n",
    "version by using the following\n",
    "\n",
    "where `programname` is the name of the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing the local places to install the utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we will install everything under the `$HOME/local`\n",
    "subdirectory inside your home, so please create it. Remember that the\n",
    "symbol `$HOME` means your home directory. The utilies will then create\n",
    "the appropriate folders there. **NOTE:** Better use the `$HOME` var\n",
    "instead of `~`, which is another way to state the name of your home.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical installation algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Download the source from the project page. This normally implies\n",
    "    downloading a tarball (file ending with `.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2`) .\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Un-compress the downloaded file. For a tarball, the command will be\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    tar xf filename.tar.gz\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Enter to the newly uncompressed folder (almost always usually `cd\n",
    "      filename`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **READ** the `README` and/or the `INSTALL` file to check for\n",
    "    important info regarding the program. SOmetimes these files tell you\n",
    "    that the installation is special and that you are required to follow\n",
    "    some special steps (that will happen with `voro++` )\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **CONFIGURATION:** You have two options, each one independent on the\n",
    "    other:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  If the program has a configure script, then just run\n",
    "\n",
    "        ``` shell\n",
    "        ./configure --help\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    to check all the available options. Since we want to install on the\n",
    "    `$HOME/local` directory, then we need to run\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you don't specify the prefix, then the program will be installed\n",
    "    on the `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` directories, whatever is the\n",
    "    default. If these commands ends successfully, it will print some\n",
    "    info to the screen and will tell you to go to the next step.\n",
    "    Otherwise you will need to read the log and fix the errors (like\n",
    "    installing a dependency).\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  If the program uses `cmake`, a makefile generator and\n",
    "\n",
    "    configurator, then you need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    mkdir build # creates a build directory to put there the temporary built files\n",
    "    cd build \n",
    "    cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/local # configure the building process for the source code located on the parent directory\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **COMPILATION:** Now that you have configured your installation, you\n",
    "    need to compile by using the GNU make utility (*Note:* All this\n",
    "    build utilities come from the gnu organization and are free software\n",
    "    as in freedom). If you have several cores, you can use them in\n",
    "    parallel, assuming the that the Makefile and your make versions\n",
    "    supports it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    make -j 3 # for three cores, but, if you are unsure, just use one core.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Any errors in this stage should be fixed before going to the next\n",
    "    one.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **INSTALLATION** After successful compilation, you can install by\n",
    "    using\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    make install\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will install the program (libraries, binaries, include files,\n",
    "    manual files, etc) onto the `prefix` directory. If you want to\n",
    "    instll system-wide (you did not set the `prefix`), then you need to\n",
    "    use `sudo make install` . In this case you don't need `sudo` since\n",
    "    you are installing on your own home.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **TESTING** In this case use a program to test your installation.\n",
    "    When you compile your program and you want to use the version that\n",
    "    you installed, you need to tell the compiler where to find the\n",
    "    libraries/includes, so you need something like\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` shell\n",
    "    g++ -L $HOME/local/lib -I $HOME/local/include  programname.cpp -llibname\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `-L $HOME/local/lib` tells the compiler to look for libraries on\n",
    "\n",
    "    the `$HOME/local/lib` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `-I $HOME/local/include` tells the compiler to look for include\n",
    "\n",
    "    files on the `$HOME/local/include` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `-llibname` tells the compiler to link with the given\n",
    "\n",
    "    library. Sometimes is not needed. Sometimes is crucial. Be careful,\n",
    "    if your library is called libfftw, you need to write `-lfftw`, not\n",
    "    `-llibfftw`.\n"

Start using `-O3 -fopenmp` and plot the curves for 1, 2, 4, 8 and the max threads in your pc. Then try the same with `-O0 -fopenmp`, but maybe you will not be able to use large sizes. How will you run this in parallel? take into account the memory consumption and also that `parallel -j jobs` is the number of processes which is different to the number of threads (a process can sapwn a lot of threads, and you should not launch more threads than available in your machine) "

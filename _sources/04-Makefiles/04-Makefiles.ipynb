    "Automating computational (and repetitive) tasks is completely related to the efficient use of a computer. Furthermore, once a task is automated, its automation process also becomes a documentation of its workings, helping maintaining and sharing it. Of course, there is always a balance between automating to be efficient or trying to automate too much:\n",

    "Fo our case, we will focus on a simple yet common computational task: generating a figure from data produced from a cpp file. Our workflow is basically creating the program -> compiling -> running to produce data -> plotting. What happens if there is a change in the program? all worflow must be rerun. But what if only the plot script changes? then only replotting is needed. A tool like `make` allows to establish dependencies among objects and to run programs when some dependency changes. The `make` tool has been around for very long, is well tested, and although its language could be cumbersome, it is good enouch for simple cases like the ones we need. There are other kinds of 'automation', like infrastructure as code, or configuration as code (see terraform, opentofu, ansible, puppet, salt, and so on). But always remember\n",
